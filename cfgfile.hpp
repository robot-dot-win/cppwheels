//Configuration File Syntax
//=====================================
//
//Syntax Description
//---------------------------
//Configuration files are plain text files that consist of a number of sections, each
//containing zero or more options:
//
//# Comment ...
//
//[section 1]
//
//[section 2]
//name 1 = value 1   # Comment ...
//name 2 = value 2
//name 3 = Value_contains_#_character   # Must followed by a comment at the line
//name 4 =           # Empty value
//name 5             # Empty value
//
//Ignored Matter
//---------------------------
//.Empty lines and lines that start with a '#' in the first non-space column are ignored.
//.From the most right character '#' to the end of the line are ignored.
//
//Sections
//---------------------------
//A section starts with a section header. The section header must be the first line
//in the configuration file, except for empty lines or comments.
//
//The section header starts with a left bracket '[', any space before which is
//ignored. Everything(including any space) between the opening bracket and the first
//right bracket ']' in the line is the section name. Any text between that right
//bracket and the end of the line is ignored.
//
//Section names are case-sensitive and not empty.
//
//Reopening Sections
//---------------------------
//A section is implicitly closed when another section header is encountered. However,
//the section may be reopened by repeating its section header, and new options can be
//defined or existing options can be redefined.
//
//Options
//---------------------------
//An option is a mapping between a name and a value. Options cannot appear outside of
//a section. Options in different sections are considered separate even if they have
//the same name.
//
//The way to define an option:
//
//name = value
//
//Option names, like section names, are case-sensitive and not empty.
//
//The option name must start in the first column of the line and stops at the separator
//'=', but the leading spaces and the spaces around the separator are optional and are
//ignored. This means that:
//
//. The name cannot start with '[' or '#', those characters start a section header or a
//  comment;
//. The name may not contain the separator '=' or the comment mark '#'.
//. Like section names, an option name may contain spaces within it, but all leading and
//  trailing spaces are removed.
//. If '=' is omitted, value is an empty string.
//
//The options's value is all the text from the separator character until the end of the
//line or the most right character '#', which starts a comment at the line. Leading and
//trailing spaces around the option value are removed, but spaces within the value are
//preserved.
//
//So if the value contains '#' charactersï¼Œyou have to add a comment at the line.
